## Dys:/function - PRELUDE

*Book 1 of the Dys:/function series.*

Something is coming, something that will consume everything.
A fractured earth, the aftermaths of terrible wars, and the beginning of an even greater one.
Dys:/function: Prelude is a collection of short stories taking place in the same fictional universe,
serving as the first in a Lovecraftian cyberpunk series about impossibly schismatic elements
of civilization facing an ancient terror.

## Dys:/function - COALESCENCE

*Book 2 of the Dys:/function series.*

Join troubled Private Investigator Conrad Trouville as he tries to solve the most difficult of
dilemmas - a personal matter. Heâ€™s not getting paid for this one, but the reward may be greater than
any monetary sum. Coalescence also brings Keystone City newcomer Gunnar, leader of a group recently set
on the trail of a sinister cult, into the fray of elaborate conspiracies involving ancient orders, mysterious
threats, and ever-present neon hedonism. Strap in for an action-packed thrill-ride that picks up the loose
threads of Dys:/function: Prelude and ties them into a Gordian knot of techno-webs that holds the
very balance of our reality in question.
